# Attendance Management System


This project shows a company named PANACEA that provides several IT solutions. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node js for the backend. It uses my SQL to store all information about the user, and after registration, the user can log in and access several features. I have used user authentication for log in /signup, jwt, middlewares. 
This project is still in the developmental stage. Many features like attendance management for users, analytics, email sending are still there to add.
